There are three variables when working towards building robot intelligence:

- **Observation**
- **Robot**
- **Task**

Each of these can be frozen or allowed to be changed, thus varying the difficulty of the Robot Intelligence Problem.

1. Task is varying, then we have a skill composition approach.  
For solving this problem, do we need Hierarchy? 

2. Robot (morphology) is varying, then we have morphology invariant policy or knowledge transfer. This is multi-embodiment learning.
Should I start working on this while the above problem is still open?

Either way, exploring Hierarchical underlying structure could be useful. Because, I suspect Task and Robot morphology is coupled (assumption, citation needed).

Skill (volunteer, learned and task oriented) vs Gait (Building blocks for skill) 

> **Current:** Plan for knowledge graph  
> Objective: Address robot varying (or evolution) problem
> Sparse vs dense reward.
