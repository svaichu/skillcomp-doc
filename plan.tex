The scope of this project is further simplified with the assumptions made for the following phases:

\subsection{Phase 1: Distillation of a single skill}

Choose a suitable application task and distill a policy from a pre-trained VLA model. Relax the problem ignoring subtask discovery, thus focusing only on the distillation of a single skill.
