% Engineer types in requirement and constraints, later receives a robot design. 


% \subsection{Engineering design of the robot} 
First step of the process is to define the robot configurtion, in other words, determining the number of link, type of joints, and other parameters. Later one can decide to either buy a robot that closely matches the requirements or design a new robot from scratch. Both these options further require several decision steps, such as selecting the actuators, materials, gripper and so on.
The traditional engineering design process is too iterative and time consuming and knowledge is not easily transferable. 
% #FIXME: add more details about the engineering design process
    
Trying to address this problem, there have been attempts like \textit{kinematic automatic}, \textit{modular joints} and \textit{Text-to-CAD}.
% #FIXME: kinematic automatic is not a good name


\subsection{Linkage Synthesis}


Challenge: Too data intensive, only 1 DoF and 2D acheived. 


\subsection{Text-to-CAD}
Text-to-CAD models generates 3D CAD geometry from text description
