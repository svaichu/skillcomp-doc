The current approaches setup the problem as multi-task RL objective or Emboidiment aware architecutes. 
In the former case, the policy cannot be easily extrapolated to unseen emboidiments. \cite{parakhAnyBodyBenchmarkSuite2025}
In the latter case, controllers or action knowledge is not carried over to the new morphology. \cite{naya-varelaMorphologicalDevelopmentRobotic2021}

A general pattern in the previous works is to use a fixed architecture and pass the morphology information as an additional input to the architecture. \cite{beaussantTransferLearningRobots2023} \cite{hongStructureAwareTransformerPolicy2021} \cite{bohlingerLearningRobotLocomotion}
